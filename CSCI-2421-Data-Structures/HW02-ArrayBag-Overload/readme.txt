*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This program utilizes the ArrayBag class that was written by Frank M. Carrano
and Tim Henry, all code is written by them unless otherwise specified. I have
overloaded the + and - operators and this program demonstrates that. An ArrayBag
object contains an array of ints. Each object's array is loaded with ints from
numbers.txt. A third object demonstrates object1 - object2, and a fourth object
demonstrates object1 + object2. After the subtraction or addition, any
duplicate numbers are deleted.
