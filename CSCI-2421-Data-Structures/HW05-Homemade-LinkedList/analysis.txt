Big O Analysis of insertFront and insertBack functions in LinkedList

insertFront
  - overall complexity: f(1) + f(1) + f(1) + f(1) + f(1) = f(5)
  - Big O = O(1) constant time
  - No part of this function is dependent on size. Inserting at the front relies
  on five variable assignments, each of which happens once. The total function
  complexity adds up to f(5), and the Big O is O(1) constant time.

insertBack
  - overall complexity: f(11) + f(n)
  - Big O = O(n) linear time
  - This function is dependent on size n to reach the end of the list. There
  are 11 constant time assignments but Big O is determined by the highest order
  function, so Big O = O(n) linear time.
