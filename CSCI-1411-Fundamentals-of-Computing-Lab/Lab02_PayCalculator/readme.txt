Write a program to determine how much to pay an employee.
Ask the employees First Name, Last Name and hourly pay rate, and number of hours
worked in week one, and week two. If the employee works more than 40 hours per
week, they earn “time and a half” (* 1.5) for the additional hours. From the
gross pay, 6% is withheld for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for Federal
Income tax, 5% is withheld for State income tax and $10 per week for union dues.
The program should ask the appropriate questions, then provide the gross pay
(without deductions) and the net-take-home pay.
