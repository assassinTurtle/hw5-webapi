                      *** Lab 03 Requirements ***

Write a program to score the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  Each of two users type
in either R, P, or S.  The program then announces the winner as well as the
basis for determining the winner: Paper covers rock, rock breaks scissors,
scissors cut paper, or tie game. Be sure to allow users to use lowercase as well
as uppercase letters. Your program should include a loop that lets the user
play again until the user exits.
